"People are all born liars and are mostly used to lying.<br>
         If a person that has never lied even once in their lives exists,<br>
          that existence itself would be a lie. For humans,<br>
           lies are an inseparable part of ourselves."

        “But Horikita, I have never once thought of you as an ally.<br>
         Not you.<br>
          Not Kushida. Not Hirata.<br>
           All people are nothing but tools.<br>
            It does not matter how its done.<br>
             It does not matter what needs to be sacrificed.<br>
              In this world, winning is everything.<br>
               As long as I win in the end…That is all that matters.”
